# Tutorial

This tutorial is intended to show you how to use `GROOT` to identify Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARGs) and generate resistome profiles as part of a metagenome analysis workflow.

***

We will use some metagenome data from a recent paper by [Winglee et al.][1], where they identify differences in the microbiota in rural versus recently urban subjects from the Hunan province of China.

In particular, we will explore this finding:

> "Urban subjects have increased gene diversity, including increased antibiotic resistance"

The aims are:

* download and check the metagenome data (x40 samples)
* classify ARG-derived reads
* generate resistome profiles for each sample
* visualise the data
* look at ARG context

***

## 1. Setup an environment

Use conda to set up an environment with all the software we need:

```
conda create -n grootTutorial -c bioconda parallel==20171222 sra-tools==2.8 fastqc==0.11.7 bbmap==37.90 multiqc==1.4 groot==0.3 seqkit==0.7.2 samtools==1.4 metacherchant==0.1.0
source activate grootTutorial
```

***

## 2. Get the data

We downloaded `additional file 1, table s1` from the [Winglee paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-017-0338-7) and saved the SRA accession number  and the rural/urban status for each metagenome used in the study.

To begin, save the accession table to file:
<details>
    <summary>samples.txt</summary>
<table>
    <tr><td>SRR4454594</td><td>rural</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SRR4454595</td><td>rural</td></tr>

Next, use `fastq-dump` to download the sequence data from the accession table:

```
cut -f 1 samples.txt | parallel --gnu "fastq-dump {}"
```

***

## 3. QC

Run [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.ba) and check the quality of the data:

```
ls *.fastq | parallel --gnu "fastqc {}"
multiqc .
```

* open up the [MultiQC](multiqc.info/) report in a browser and check the data
* samples should all be clear of adapters
* 3 samples failed on sequence quality

Try cleaning up the 3 failed samples using [BBduk](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbmap-guide/):

```
ls SRR4454598.fastq SRR4454599.fastq SRR4454610.fastq | parallel --gnu "bbduk.sh in={} out={/.}.trimmed.fastq qtrim=rl trimq=20 minlength=97"
```

* check the data is now passing on sequence quality
* replace the original failed files with the trimmed ones

***

## 2. Run GROOT

Download the pre-clustered [ARG-ANNOT](http://en.mediterranee-infection.com/article.php?laref=283%26titre=arg-annot) database:

```
groot get -d arg-annot
```

Index the ARG-ANNOT database:

```
groot index -i arg-annot.90 -o groot-index -l 100 -p 8
```

*  the metagenomes reads we downloaded earlier are 100 bases long
* we need to set the  indexing window size (l) to 100 to match the query read length
* the default MinHash settings should be fine but you can play with them (`groot index --help`)

Align the reads against the index:

```
ls *.fastq | parallel --gnu "groot align -i groot-index -f {} -p 8 > {/.}.bam"
```

* for each sample, the align subcommand produces a BAM file containing all graph traversals for each read
* each BAM file essentially contains the ARG-derived reads in each sample

### 2.a. Compare ARG diversity

Now that we have classified ARG-derived reads from all of the samples, we can compare the proportion of ARG-derived reads in urban vs. rural samples. We are aiming to replicate the analysis as presented in figure 5d of the [Winglee paper][1]:

![fig5](http://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40168-017-0338-7/MediaObjects/40168_2017_338_Fig5_HTML.gif)

 Firstly, calculate the proportion of ARG-derived reads in each sample and save to a csv file:

``` bash
while read -r line
do
    ID=$(echo $line | cut -f1 -d ' ')
    status=$(echo $line | cut -f2 -d ' ')
    bamFile=${ID}.bam
    mapped=$(samtools view -c -F 4 $bamFile)
    proportion=$(echo "scale=10 ; $mapped / 10000000" | bc)
    printf "$status,$proportion\n" >> proportion-ARG-derived.csv
done < samples.txt
```

Now create a simple box plot using R:

``` r
library(ggplot2)

#Â read in the data and log transform the proportion of ARG classified reads
data <- read.csv(file='proportion-ARG-derived.csv', header=FALSE)
colnames(data) <- c("status", "proportion")
data[2] <- log(data[2], 10)

# plot the data and save to file
png(file = "boxplot.png")
ggplot(data, aes(x=status, y=proportion)) + geom_boxplot(fill="slateblue", alpha=0.8) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3, position = "jitter") + xlab("status") + ylab("log10(proportion ARG classified reads)")
dev.off()
```

This should produce a box plot like this:

![boxplot](_static/boxplot.png)

We have now compared the proportion of ARG-derived reads from urban and rural samples. This has just used the ARG-derived reads, as was done in the original paper. Although the mean proportion of ARG-derived reads is greater in the urban set, our figure still looks a little different to the published figure. More to come on this...

### 2.b. Generate resistome profiles

The main advantage of GROOT is that it will generate a resistome profile by reporting full-length ARGs. To do this, we need to use the `groot report` command. The report command will output a tab separated file that contains: ARG, read count, ARG length, coverage.

First, report the resistome profiles:

```
ls *.bam | parallel --gnu "groot report -i {} -c 1 --plotCov > {/.}.report"
```

* `-c 1` tells groot to only report ARGs that have been entirely covered by reads, I.E. a full-length,100% identity match
* `--plotCov` tells groot to generate coverage plots for each ARG it reports

Next, combine the reports for each status (rural/urban):

``` bash
while read -r line
do
    ID=$(echo $line | cut -f1 -d ' ')
    status=$(echo $line | cut -f2 -d ' ')
    if [ -s $ID.report ]
        then
            cat $ID.report >> combined-profiles.$status.tsv
    fi
done < samples.txt
wc -l combined-profiles.*
```

We have now generated a resistome profile for each sample, using only full-length ARG sequences (present in the ARG-ANNOT database).

The number of ARGs found isn't very large and the difference between rural and urban isn't that big... Let's take a look at the coverage plots in the `./groot-plots` folder. For example:

![coplot](_static/cov-plot.png)

We can see that the 5' and 3' ends of the genes have low coverage compared to the rest of each gene. The way GROOT works by default is to seed reads covering only the ARGs in the database. So reads that only partially cover a gene (at the 5' and 3' ends) are unlikely to seed. In low coverage samples, which are samples are likely to be, this means that we may not annotate some ARGs using the default settings.

We can try 2 things to report more ARGs:

* set the `--lowCov` flag for groot report -> this will report ARGs with no coverage in the first few bases at the 5' or 3' ends
* re-index the database using a shorter MinHash signature (`-s`) or lower Jaccard similarity threshold (`-j`) -> this will increase the chance of seeding reads that partially cover a gene

Let's try option 1:

```
ls *.bam | parallel --gnu "groot report -i {} --lowCov > {/.}.report"
```

More to content to come...
